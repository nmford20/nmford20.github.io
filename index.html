								<b>Greetings!</b>
								<br> I am an Astrophysics PhD student at McGill University in Montr√©al, Canada. I currently work in the research group of <a href="https://www.dhaggard.physics.mcgill.ca/">Dr. Daryl Haggard</a>. I use telescopes around the world -- and in space! -- to accretion and emission from supermassive black holes.
								I am passionate about science visualization, and I enjoy finding new opportunities to combine art and astrophysics. I am also involved in astronomy outreach through the Trottier Space Institute.

								<br>PhD in Physics at McGill University (expected 2027) 
								<br>MSc in Physics at McGill University (2023) 
								<br>BA in Astrophysics & Studio Art at Williams College (2020)
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Current Research Interests:</b> <br>High energy astrophysics, compact objects, multimessenger astronomy.
								<br>(Previously studied the Epoch of Reionization, Green Pea galaxies, cosmic rays, and transiting exoplanets)

								<b>Neutron Stars and Merger Simulations (Past Project): </b><br> 
								As a Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship Program participant at the DOE's Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, I worked on two computational astrophysics projects in the Lab's Center for Computational Science & Engineering.
								Under the supervision of <a href="https://ccse.lbl.gov/people/almgren/">Dr. Ann Almgren</a>, <a href="https://ccse.lbl.gov/people/dewillcox/index.html">Dr. Don Willcox</a>, and 
								<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sherwoodrichers/home">Dr. Sherwood Richers</a>, I used the adaptive mesh refinement <a href="https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/">AMReX</a> code suite to simulate complex physics occuring around neutron stars. 
								<br>
								I simulated hydrodynamics during a Type I x-ray burst around an accreting neutron star using the <a href="https://amrex-astro.github.io/">AMReX-Astro</a> 
								<a href="https://github.com/AMReX-Astro/Castro">Castro</a> code. I explored how the neutron star surface temperature and rotation rate impact the strength and propagation of a hydrodynamical flame burning along an accreting neutron star's surface.
								<br> 
								I also simulated neutrino emission around a neutron star merger using the particle-in-cell <a href="https://github.com/AMReX-Astro/Emu/tree/release">Emu</a> code. Specifically, I explored how neutrinos oscillate between different flavors after being emitted during a merger. Neutrinos
								are emitted copiously during a merger, and their flavor oscillations are relevant because they can impact r-process nucleosynthesis in the post-merger environment. I ran simulations to investigate fast (~ nanoseconds) flavor oscillations in one, two, and three dimensions.
								<br>
								The results of this research are included in two published papers <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abee87/pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.083013">here</a>, with another paper in the works!

								<i>An illustration of our 2D x-ray burst simulation setup. A neutron star (white/blue) surrounded by an atmosphere of accreted material (light blue/orange haze). The neutron star accretes material from a companion star (red, in background). The accreted material acts as a fuel source and, when ignited, undergoes thermonuclear
								burning. The burning forms a flame (light orange) that propagates laterally to the right. The blue arrows represent the simulation axes, and the white arrow represents the axis of neutron star rotation and symmetry.</i>

								<b>Epoch of Reionization Lyman Continuum Escape (Past Project): </b><br> 
								For my undergraduate thesis, I worked with Dr. Anne Jaskot and investigated how galaxies might have 
								contributed ionizing radiation (i.e. Lyman Continuum; LyC) during the Epoch of Reionization. Specifically, I studied <i>Hubble</i> and <i>SDSS</i> spectra 
								for a sample of low-redshift star forming galaxies to search for evidence of ionizing radiation escape and test proposed indicators of LyC escape. 
								I looked for correlations between LyC escape and properties such as the strength of certain spectral features, the galaxies' metallicities, and the galaxies' star 
								formation activity.
								<br> 
								The results of this research will be included in two upcoming papers, so stay tuned!
